        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This Jupyter notebook explores the fascinating optical properties of one-dimensional photonic crystals (1D PhCs), which are periodic dielectric structures designed to manipulate light propagation through interference effects. 1D PhCs, often implemented as Distributed Bragg Reflectors (DBRs), are widely used in applications such as optical filters, mirrors, and sensors due to their ability to create photonic bandgaps (PBGs)—wavelength ranges where light propagation is forbidden. By introducing defects or varying structural parameters, these crystals can exhibit tailored optical responses, making them a rich subject for both theoretical and applied studies. In this notebook, we systematically investigate the reflectance and transmittance spectra of 1D PhCs, analyze how their properties depend on various parameters, and examine their behavior under different conditions such as oblique incidence and defect incorporation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook is structured to cover a comprehensive study of 1D PhCs, divided into three main sections, each building on the previous to provide a holistic understanding of these structures:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **1D Photonic Crystal: Fundamentals and Spectra**  \n",
        "   We begin by establishing the foundational behavior of a 1D PhC without defects. In Section [1.1](#11-plotting-the-reflectance-and-transmittance-spectra), we calculate and plot the reflectance and transmittance spectra using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM), a numerical technique that models light propagation through layered media, revealing the characteristic PBG where reflectance is near 100%. In Section [1.2](#12-study-of-the-dbr-parameters), we study the influence of DBR parameters on the spectra. Specifically, in Section [1.2.1](#121-number-of-periods), we vary the number of periods (alternating layers) and observe that increasing periods leads to a sharper, more prominent PBG, with reflectance reaching 100% and side lobes becoming more concentrated—explained by enhanced interference effects. In Section [1.2.2](#122-refractive-index-of-constituent-materials), we explore the effect of refractive index contrast between the constituent layers, finding that a higher contrast widens the PBG due to stronger reflections at interfaces. Finally, in Section [1.3](#13-wavelength-dependent-spectral-evolution-of-1d-photonic-crystals), we animate the spectral evolution with wavelength, providing a dynamic visualization of how the PBG and side lobes shift across the wavelength range.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **1D Photonic Crystal with Defect Layers**  \n",
        "   Next, we introduce defects into the 1D PhC to create localized states within the PBG, enabling applications like narrowband filters. In Section [2.1](#21-symmetric-and-asymmetric-defect-pc), we compare symmetric and asymmetric defect structures, analyzing their spectral features and noting how asymmetry influences the position and intensity of defect modes. Section [2.2](#22-study-of-the-defect-parameters) focuses on tuning defect layer parameters: in Section [2.2.1](#221-thickness-of-the-defect-layer), we vary the defect layer thickness, observing shifts in the defect mode wavelength due to changes in optical path length; in Section [2.2.2](#222-refractive-index-of-the-defect-layer), we adjust the defect layer’s refractive index, which alters the defect mode’s position and strength; and in Section [2.2.3](#223-number-of-periods-of-the-dbr), we examine the effect of the number of DBR periods on defect modes, finding that more periods enhance mode confinement. Section [2.3](#23-wavelength-dependent-spectral-evolution-of-1d-phc-with-defects) provides an animation of the spectral evolution for defective PhCs, visualizing how defect modes evolve with wavelength. In Section [2.4](#24-comparison-of-the-defect-types), we compare different defect types, highlighting the distinct spectral signatures of symmetric versus asymmetric defects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **1D Photonic Crystal under Oblique Incidence**  \n",
        "   Finally, we explore the behavior of 1D PhCs under oblique incidence, where the angle of incoming light affects the optical response. In Section [3.1](#31-spectral-analysis-for-te-and-tm-modes), we analyze the spectra for TE (transverse electric) and TM (transverse magnetic) modes, noting polarization-dependent effects such as the Brewster angle influence on TM modes. Section [3.2](#32-variation-in-spectra-with-angle-of-incidence) investigates how the spectra vary with the angle of incidence, observing that the PBG shifts to shorter wavelengths and the transmission peak for TE modes decreases, while TM modes show a non-monotonic behavior peaking around 60 degrees due to minimized reflection. In Section [3.3](#33-1d-phc-with-defect-layer-under-oblique-incidence), we introduce a defect layer under oblique incidence, studying how defect modes shift with angle. Section [3.4](#34-angular-response-of-defect-modes-in-1d-photonic-crystals) examines the angular response of defect modes in detail, showing how their position and intensity depend on incidence angle and polarization. Lastly, in Section [3.5](#35-spectral-evolution-of-tetm-modes-with-incident-angle), we animate the angular dependence of TE and TM spectra, providing a dynamic view of how the PBG and defect modes evolve with angle.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each section follows a step-by-step approach, starting with theoretical background, followed by numerical simulations using Python (via the TMM implemented in the provided code), and concluding with detailed explanations of the observed trends. We leverage visualizations—plots, subplots, and animations—to illustrate spectral changes, ensuring a clear understanding of the underlying physics. By progressively building complexity from fundamental PhC properties to defect-induced effects and oblique incidence, this notebook offers a thorough exploration of 1D photonic crystals, blending simulation, analysis, and visualization to deepen insights into their optical behavior. The references in Section 4 provide further reading to support the concepts discussed."

        "##### **Understanding the 1D Photonic Crystal Setup**\n",
        "\n",
        "Your 1D PhC is a quarter-wave stack, consisting of alternating layers of high refractive index ($n_H = 2.1$) and low refractive index ($n_L = 1.5$) materials. The layer thicknesses are designed to satisfy the quarter-wave condition at a central wavelength $\\lambda_0 = 1200 \\, \\text{nm}$:\n",
        "\n",
        "- $d_1 = \\lambda_0 / (4 n_H) = 1200 / (4 \\times 2.1) = 142.86 \\, \\text{nm}$\n",
        "- $d_2 = \\lambda_0 / (4 n_L) = 1200 / (4 \\times 1.5) = 200 \\, \\text{nm}$\n",
        "\n",
        "The structure has a total of $N$ layers (e.g., $HLHL\\ldots$), where $N = 6,8, 12, 16, 30, 50$ in our simulations, corresponding to $N/2$ periods (since each period is an $HL$ pair). The incident medium and substrate both have a refractive index of $n_{\\text{inc}} = n_{\\text{sub}} = 1.0$ (air), and the reflectance is calculated over a wavelength range of 600–1800 nm using the TMM in the `PhotonicCrystalPeriodComparer` class.\n",
        "\n",
        "The PBG arises from the periodic variation in refractive index, causing destructive interference for certain wavelengths that prevents light propagation, resulting in high reflectance. For a quarter-wave stack, the PBG is centered at $\\lambda_0 = 1200 \\, \\text{nm}$, where the optical thickness per period is $\\lambda_0 / 2$.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Explaining Observations**\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s break down each observed phenomenon and connect it to the underlying physics.\n",
        "\n",
        "**I. The Photonic Bandgap Becomes Sharper and More Prominent**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Observation**: As the number of layers increases from 6 to 50, the PBG in the reflectance spectra becomes narrower at the edges (sharper) and more pronounced in its height and definition.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation**:\n",
        "- **Physics**: The sharpness and prominence of the PBG depend on the number of periods ($N/2$) in the PhC. Each period contributes to the interference that forms the bandgap. With more layers, there are more interfaces where reflections occur, enhancing the constructive interference of reflected waves within the PBG wavelengths. This increases the reflectance and makes the transition from low to high reflectance at the PBG edges steeper.\n",
        "- **How It Works**: In a quarter-wave stack, reflections from each interface add constructively for wavelengths near $\\lambda_0$. With few layers (e.g., 6), the interference is less effective, resulting in a broad, less prominent PBG with a peak reflectance below 100%. As you add layers (e.g., up to 50), the cumulative effect of these reflections grows, making the PBG more defined and its edges sharper.\n",
        "- **TMM Insight**: In the code, the `PhotonicCrystalPeriodComparer` class computes the total transfer matrix by multiplying individual layer matrices (via `_calculate_total_transfer_matrix`). Each additional period adds another matrix multiplication, amplifying the reflection amplitude within the PBG. The reflectance $R = |M_{21} / M_{11}|^2$ increases, and the edges steepen because the matrix elements transition more abruptly with wavelength as $N$ grows.\n",
        "- **Result**: For 8 layers (4 periods), the PBG is broad and rounded; for 50 layers (25 periods), it’s nearly rectangular with steep edges, as seen in the subplots.\n",
        "\n",
        "**II. The Top of the Bandgap Reaches 100% Reflectance**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Observation**: With increasing layers, the peak reflectance within the PBG rises, reaching 100% by 16 or 50 layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation**:\n",
        "- **Physics**: The maximum reflectance of 100% occurs when the PhC becomes a perfect reflector within the PBG, a property of quarter-wave stacks with sufficient periods. With few layers, some light transmits through due to incomplete interference. More layers enhance the destructive interference of transmitted light, reducing transmission to near zero and driving reflectance to 100%.\n",
        "- **Quarter-Wave Design**: At $\\lambda_0 = 1200 \\, \\text{nm}$, the optical thicknesses ($n_1 d_1 = n_2 d_2 = \\lambda_0 / 4$) ensure that reflections align in phase, maximizing reflectance. With more layers, this effect strengthens exponentially.\n",
        "- **TMM Insight**: In `calculate_all_spectra`, reflectance is $R = |M_{21} / M_{11}|^2$. When $M_{11}$ (related to transmission) becomes very small within the PBG—due to more matrix multiplications with increasing $N$, $R$ approaches 1 (100%). The code’s condition `if abs(M11) < 1e-15` explicitly sets $R = 1.0$ in such cases, reflecting this physical limit.\n",
        "- **Result**: For 6 layers, the peak reflectance is around 70–80%; by 50 layers, it’s a flat 100% across the PBG, as the structure fully blocks transmission.\n",
        "\n",
        "**III. The Side Lobes Become More Concentrated**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Observation**: Outside the PBG, the oscillatory features (side lobes) in the reflectance spectra become more numerous and closely spaced as layers increase.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation**:\n",
        "- **Physics**: Side lobes are oscillations in reflectance outside the PBG, resulting from Fabry-Pérot-like interference between reflections at the PhC’s boundaries. Their spacing and number depend on the optical thickness of the entire structure, which scales with the number of layers.\n",
        "- **How It Works**: The free spectral range (FSR)—the wavelength spacing between side lobe peaks—is inversely proportional to the total optical thickness: $\\text{FSR} \\propto 1 / [N/2 \\times (n_1 d_1 + n_2 d_2)]$. As $N$ increases, the optical thickness grows, reducing the FSR and packing more oscillations into the 600–1800 nm range, making the side lobes appear more concentrated.\n",
        "- **TMM Insight**: The `_propagation_matrix` introduces a phase $\\phi = 2\\pi n d / \\lambda$, and the total phase across all layers increases with $N$. This leads to more frequent interference maxima and minima outside the PBG, calculated in `calculate_all_spectra` and plotted in `plot_comparison_spectrum`.\n",
        "- **Result**: For 6 layers, side lobes are broad and sparse; for 50 layers, they’re rapid and dense, especially near the PBG edges (e.g., 1000 nm and 1400 nm), as seen in the plots.\n",

        "The observation that a higher contrast between the refractive indices of adjacent layers (i.e., a larger difference between $n_H$ and $n_L$) leads to a wider and more broadened Photonic Band Gap (PBG) in a 1D Photonic Crystal is a fundamental principle of these periodic structures. This can be explained by considering the underlying physics of wave propagation and reflection at interfaces:\n",
        "\n",
        "**I. Bragg Reflection and Interface Reflection Coefficient:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Bragg Condition:** The formation of a PBG is primarily due to Bragg reflection. In a 1D PhC, this occurs when the reflected waves from successive interfaces interfere constructively. The central wavelength of the bandgap ($\\lambda_0$) for a quarter-wave stack is typically given by $2(n_H d_H + n_L d_L) = m\\lambda_0$, where $m$ is an integer (usually 1 for the fundamental bandgap). For quarter-wave layers, $d_H = \\lambda_0 / (4n_H)$ and $d_L = \\lambda_0 / (4n_L)$, which simplifies the condition for the central wavelength.\n",
        "* **Fresnel Reflection Coefficients:** The strength of the reflection at each interface between two different dielectric media is governed by the Fresnel equations. For normal incidence, the amplitude reflection coefficient ($r$) at an interface from a medium with refractive index $n_i$ to a medium with refractive index $n_j$ is given by:\n",
        "\n",
        "    $$\n",
        "    r = (n_i - n_j) / (n_i + n_j)\n",
        "    $$\n",
        "\n",
        "    The power reflectance at a single interface is $|r|^2$.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Impact of Index Contrast:** From the formula, it's clear that as the difference between $n_i$ and $n_j$ (i.e., the refractive index contrast, $|n_H - n_L|$) increases, the magnitude of the reflection coefficient $|r|$ at each interface also increases. This means that a larger proportion of the incident light is reflected at each boundary.\n",
        "\n",
        "**II. Wider Bandgap Due to Stronger Reflections:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Stronger \"Mirror\" Effect:** When the refractive index contrast is high, each individual interface acts as a more efficient \"mirror.\" The stronger reflections at each interface mean that fewer layers are needed to achieve a high overall reflectance, and more importantly, the range of wavelengths over which significant reflection occurs is broadened.\n",
        "* **Dispersion Relation (Band Structure):** The width of the PBG is directly related to the strength of the periodic potential created by the alternating refractive indices. In the context of solid-state physics, this is analogous to the formation of electronic band gaps in crystals due to the periodic potential of the atoms. A larger contrast creates a \"deeper\" potential well (or higher barrier for light waves), which in turn leads to a wider forbidden energy (frequency) band.\n",
        "* **Coupling of Forward and Backward Waves:** The PBG arises from the strong coupling between forward-propagating and backward-propagating waves within the periodic structure. A higher refractive index contrast leads to a stronger scattering of light at each interface, which enhances this coupling. This stronger coupling effectively \"pushes\" the edges of the bandgap further apart, resulting in a wider bandgap.\n",
        "\n",
        "**III. Mathematical Relationship:**\n",
        "\n",
        "While the exact analytical expression for the bandgap width can be complex, for a simple 1D quarter-wave stack, the relative bandwidth ($\\Delta\\lambda / \\lambda_0$) is approximately related to the refractive indices by:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} \\approx \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\arcsin \\left( \\frac{n_H - n_L}{n_H + n_L} \\right)\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "From this approximation, it's evident that as the refractive index contrast $(n_H - n_L)$ increases, the value of the argument to arcsin increases, leading to a larger $\\arcsin$ value and thus a wider $\\Delta\\lambda$.\n",

        "A defect is introduced in a one-dimensional (1D) photonic multilayer film by breaking the spatial periodicity of the photonic crystal (PC) structure, typically by inserting a \"defect layer\" within the periodic arrangement. This defect layer functions as a cavity resonator when specific resonant conditions are met.\n",

        "* **Asymmetric Defective PC:** This structure is generally denoted as $A/(HL)^N D (HL)^N/S$. Here, 'A' represents the incident medium (e.g., air), 'H' and 'L' are the high and low-refractive index layers, respectively, 'D' is the defect layer, 'N' is the number of periods for the periodic bilayers, and 'S' denotes the substrate.\n",

In quarter-wavelength stack designs, the high and low-index layers typically have thicknesses defined by $n_H d_H = n_L d_L = \\lambda_0/4$, where $\\lambda_0$ is the design wavelength. The defect layer thickness can be a quarter-wave ($\\lambda_0/4$) or half-wave ($\\lambda_0/2$) thickness relative to the design wavelength.\n",

The typical even/odd mode splitting characteristic of the $\\lambda_0/4$ symmetric defect is altered when the defect itself is a half-wave plate (or multiples). The half-wave defect, despite the symmetric placement of Bragg mirrors, creates a condition where resonance occurs precisely at $\\lambda_0$.\n",

It appears that for this specific phase matching, the conditions for two separate even/odd modes (that are typically split from $\\lambda_0$) are not met in the same way. Instead, a strong, single resonant mode is supported directly at $\\lambda_0$. This can be thought of as the defect layer being \"transparent\" or perfectly impedance-matched to the surrounding structures *at that specific wavelength $\\lambda_0$* due to its half-wave nature, allowing a standing wave to form efficiently.\n",
        "        * **Online References:** Finding a direct, simple theoretical explanation for *why only one peak at $\\lambda_0$ for a half-wave defect in a symmetric PC* (as opposed to the well-documented two peaks for a quarter-wave defect) can be nuanced. Most texts focus on the quarter-wave defect. However, the behavior is consistent with Fabry-Perot theory where a cavity of optical length $m\\lambda/2$ supports standing waves and thus resonance. The symmetry of the mirrors $(HL)^N ... (LH)^N$ still plays a role, but the half-wave defect condition dominates to create a strong resonance at $\\lambda_0$. More advanced coupled-mode theory or detailed phase analysis would be needed for a rigorous derivation of why the even/odd modes might degenerate or one becomes suppressed in this half-wave defect scenario. However, the calculation from Wu and Wang's own formula (Eq. 17) mathematically supports $T(\\lambda_0)=1$.\n"

        "The behavior of defect modes in a 1D Photonic Crystal (PC) is a strong function of the defect layer's refractive index, $n_D$. This dependence varies significantly with the PC's structural symmetry and the defect's optical thickness. We will analyze the transmittance peaks, which represent these defect modes.\n",

        "    * This configuration produces a single, prominent peak at the design wavelength, $\\lambda_0$. The height of this peak is dictated by the impedance match between the defect layer and the surrounding media (assumed to be air/vacuum with n=1).\n",

        "    * While there isn't a simple formula for the height of these off-center peaks, the same physical principle applies: a larger $n_D$ leads to a greater impedance mismatch, which generally lowers the overall efficiency of the resonance and reduces the peak transmittance.\n",

        "    * This is the classic symmetric case, which produces **two defect modes** positioned on either side of the design wavelength $\\lambda_0$. Transmittance at $\\lambda_0$ itself is near zero.\n",
        "    * The two peaks arise from the structural symmetry, which supports two distinct resonant field solutions (even and odd symmetry) that have different energies.\n",
        "    * The positions of these two peaks will shift slightly as $n_D$ is varied. This is because the exact resonance condition depends on the phase shifts from both the defect layer and the DBR mirrors, and changing $n_D$ alters this delicate phase balance.\n",

        "    * The peak height is consistently **100% transmittance ($T=1$)**, regardless of the defect's refractive index $n_D$ or the number of periods N.\n",
        "    * This is mathematically confirmed by the transmittance formula for the symmetric case. When $n_D d_D = m \\cdot (\\lambda_0/2)$ (where m is an integer), the phase term $\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda_0}n_D d_D$ becomes $m\\pi$. This makes the $\\sin^2$ term in the denominator zero and the $\\cos^2$ term one, simplifying the equation to:\n",

        "    * This special condition creates a state of perfect resonance at $\\lambda_0$, where the half-wave defect layer allows for maximum transmission, effectively making the structure transparent at that specific wavelength."

        "\n",
        "The number of periods, N, in the Distributed Bragg Reflectors (DBRs) that surround the defect layer is one of the most critical design parameters. It directly controls the \"quality\" of the resonant cavity, leading to significant changes in the Photonic Band Gap (PBG) and the characteristics of the defect modes.\n",

        "\n",
        "##### **I. The Two Fundamental Effects of Increasing N**\n",
        "\n",
        "Increasing the number of periods has two primary physical consequences that explain all the behaviors you observed:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Band Gap Widening and Sharpening:**\n",
        "    As N increases, the DBRs become more efficient mirrors. This improves the PBG in two ways: the gap becomes significantly wider, and the band edges (the transition from high transmittance to high reflectance) become much sharper and more defined. A wider and \"squarer\" bandgap creates more spectral \"space,\" which allows for the existence of higher-order resonant modes that would be suppressed or fall outside a narrower bandgap.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Increased Cavity Q-Factor:**\n",
        "   The \"Quality Factor\" (Q-factor) describes the sharpness of the resonance within the defect cavity. As N increases, the reflectivity of the DBR mirrors improves, causing light to remain confined in the cavity for longer periods. This results in a much higher Q-factor, which manifests as:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * **Narrower Resonance Peaks:** The transmittance peaks become significantly sharper and more defined.\n",
        "   \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **II. Analysis of Specific Scenarios**\n",
        "\n",
        "The interplay of these two effects—a widening bandgap and an increasing Q-factor—explains the transitions we see in the figure.\n",

        "      * **Low N (e.g., 4-12):** The structure supports a **single fundamental defect mode** at the design wavelength, $\\lambda_0$. The PBG is not yet wide enough to accommodate other modes.\n",
        "      * **High N (e.g., 14, 16):** The PBG is now significantly wider. This allows **higher-order modes**, which were previously suppressed, to appear within the bandgap as new side peaks. This transforms the structure from a single-channel filter into a **three-channel filter**, explaining the emergence of the two side peaks we observed.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Case B: Even Optical Thickness (e.g., $d_D \\cdot n_D = \\lambda_0/2$)**\n",
        "      * **Low N (e.g., up to 12):** The structure supports **two fundamental defect modes**, consistent with the theory that an even-multiple defect thickness in an asymmetric structure behaves like a symmetric one.\n",
        "      * **High N (e.g., 14, 16):** Again, the widened PBG provides the necessary spectral space for **additional higher-order modes** to appear alongside the original two. This results in the four-peak structure we observed.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Symmetric Defect: A/(HL)ᴺ D (LH)ᴺ/S**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Case A: Odd Optical Thickness (e.g., $d_D \\cdot n_D = \\lambda_0/4$)**\n",
        "      * This configuration fundamentally supports **two defect modes** due to the structure's reflection symmetry, which allows for distinct \"even\" and \"odd\" field solutions. The figure correctly shows these two peaks. As N increases, these peaks become sharper (higher Q-factor), and the widening PBG can theoretically support even more modes, though the fundamental two remain the most prominent.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Case B: Even Optical Thickness (e.g., $d_D \\cdot n_D = \\lambda_0/2$)**\n",
        "     * This structure exhibits a **single, dominant defect mode** at $\\lambda_0$, resulting from the perfect resonance condition of the half-wave defect layer, which yields 100% transmittance. As the number of periods (N) increases from 4 to 12 on each side of the defect, the central transmittance peak becomes much sharper and more pronounced, reaching its maximum sharpness at N = 12. Beyond N = 12, further increases in the number of periods cause the height of the central peak to decrease, and additional higher-order defect modes begin to appear within the PBG. For N = 14 and 16, a total of three defect modes are observed within the bandgap. Increasing N even further can introduce more modes, always resulting in an odd total number of defect modes within the PBG."

        "#### Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This code defines a Python class `PhotonicCrystal1DObliqueIncidence` that models a **1D photonic crystal** (PhC) using the **Transfer Matrix Method (TMM)** for **oblique incidence**. The PhC consists of alternating layers of two materials with different refractive indices (`n1`, `n2`). The main goal is to compute and visualize the **reflectance** and **transmittance** spectra as a function of wavelength, angle of incidence, and polarization.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Features\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Quarter-wave stack:** Layer thicknesses are set so that each is a quarter of the design wavelength in its material.\n",
        "- **Oblique incidence:** The angle at which light enters the structure can be set, not just normal (perpendicular) incidence.\n",
        "- **Polarization:** Both TE (transverse electric) and TM (transverse magnetic) modes are supported.\n",
        "- **Spectrum calculation:** Computes how much light is reflected and transmitted for a range of wavelengths.\n",
        "- **Plotting:** Uses Plotly to visualize the spectra, optionally comparing oblique and normal incidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### How Polarization Modes Are Introduced\n",
        "\n",
        "Polarization is handled by the `mode` parameter, which can be `\"TE\"` or `\"TM\"`:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **TE (Transverse Electric):** Electric field is perpendicular to the plane of incidence.\n",
        "- **TM (Transverse Magnetic):** Magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of incidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "The difference appears in the `_transmission_matrix` method, which calculates the interface matrix differently for TE and TM:\n",

        "#### Role of Angle of Incidence\n",
        "\n",
        "- The **angle of incidence** (`angle_incidence_deg`) is converted to radians and used to compute the propagation angles in each layer using **Snell's Law**.\n",
        "- These angles affect both the **propagation matrix** (how light travels through each layer) and the **interface matrix** (how light reflects/transmits at each boundary).\n",
        "- As the angle increases, the effective optical path length in each layer changes, and so do the reflection/transmission coefficients.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Effect on the Photonic Band Gap (PBG)\n",
        "\n",
        "- The **Photonic Band Gap (PBG)** is the range of wavelengths where light is strongly reflected (high reflectance, low transmittance).\n",
        "- **Changing the angle of incidence** shifts and reshapes the PBG:\n",
        "  - For **TE and TM modes**, the shift is different due to their distinct boundary conditions.\n",
        "  - **Increasing the angle** generally shifts the PBG to **shorter wavelengths** (blue shift) and can also **narrow** or **broaden** the gap, depending on the structure and polarization.\n",
        "  - For TM polarization, the PBG can even shrink or disappear at high angles due to the Brewster angle effect.\n",

        "The figure demonstrates the behavior of the Photonic Band Gap (PBG) for a standard 1D PC (a Bragg reflector) at various angles of incidence ($\\theta$). The two key observations are:\n",
        "1.  The entire PBG shifts towards shorter wavelengths (a \"blue shift\") as the angle of incidence increases from 0°.\n",
        "2.  The width of the PBG changes differently for TE and TM polarized light: it widens for TE mode and shrinks for TM mode.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is an explanation of this behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **I. Blue Shift of the Photonic Band Gap with Increasing Angle**\n",
        "\n",
        "The fundamental condition for constructive interference that forms a Bragg reflector is dependent on the optical path length within the layers. For normal incidence ($\\theta = 0^\\circ$), the design wavelength $\\lambda_0$ is centered where the optical thickness of each layer is a quarter of the wavelength ($n \\cdot d = \\lambda_0 / 4$).\n",
        "\n",
        "However, for oblique incidence ($\\theta > 0^\\circ$), the path length of light within each layer increases. The *effective optical thickness* relevant for interference is not just $n \\cdot d$, but rather $n \\cdot d \\cdot \\cos(\\theta')$, where $\\theta'$ is the angle of propagation inside the material.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Bragg condition for the center of the bandgap at oblique incidence becomes:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "2(n_H d_H \\cos\\theta_H + n_L d_L \\cos\\theta_L) = m \\cdot \\lambda_{center}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "For a quarter-wave stack designed for $\\lambda_0$ at normal incidence, this simplifies. The new center wavelength, $\\lambda_c(\\theta)$, is related to the design wavelength $\\lambda_0$ by:\n",

        "$$\n",

        "\n",
        "**In simpler terms: As you tilt the angle of incidence, the effective path length through the layers decreases. To maintain the same constructive interference condition, the wavelength of light must also get shorter. This causes the entire bandgap structure to shift to the blue (shorter wavelengths), which is clearly visible for both TE and TM modes in the plots.**\n",

        "#### **II. Different Behavior of Band Gap Width for TE and TM Modes**\n",
        "\n",
        "The width of the PBG is determined by the reflection strength at the interfaces between the high-index ($n_H$) and low-index ($n_L$) layers. This reflection strength is described by the Fresnel reflection coefficients, which are different for TE and TM polarized light at oblique incidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **TE Mode (s-polarization):**\n",
        "    * For TE polarized light, the effective refractive index for reflection can be thought of as $n \\cos(\\theta')$.\n",
        "    * The Fresnel reflection coefficient's magnitude *increases* as the angle of incidence increases. A stronger reflection at each interface leads to a more efficient Bragg reflection.\n",
        "    * **Conclusion:** Because the reflection contrast between layers becomes stronger with increasing angle for TE mode, the **PBG becomes wider.**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **TM Mode (p-polarization):**\n",
        "    * For TM polarized light, the effective refractive index for reflection is $n / \\cos(\\theta')$.\n",
        "    * The Fresnel reflection coefficient's magnitude *decreases* as the angle of incidence increases, eventually reaching zero at a specific angle known as the **Brewster's angle**.\n",
        "    * **Conclusion:** Because the reflection contrast between layers becomes weaker with increasing angle for TM mode, the **PBG shrinks**. If the angle of incidence were to reach the Brewster's angle for the nH/nL interface, the bandgap would vanish entirely because there would be no reflection at that specific angle.\n",
        "\n",
        "This difference in the angular dependence of the Fresnel reflection coefficients for the two polarizations is the fundamental reason why the PBG width behaves differently for TE and TM modes, exactly as shown in the figure.\n",
